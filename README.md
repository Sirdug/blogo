## Self-hosting

There are two ways to self-host Blogo:

## Docker

1. Get the .env file:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluja/blogo/main/example.env -O .env
```
2. Edit the `.env` file to fit your needs.

3. Run blogo:

```bash
docker run --name blogo -v $(pwd)/articles:/app/articles -p 3000:3000 pluja/blogo -d
```

Blogo is now available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can now [create your first article](#create-your-first-article).

### Docker Compose

The easiest way to self-host Blogo is by using Docker. I will try to publish a Docker image soon, but for now you can build it yourself:

1. Get the docker-compose.yml:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluja/blogo/main/docker-compose.yml
```

2. Get the .env file:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluja/blogo/main/example.env -O .env
```
> Edit the `.env` file to fit your needs.

3. Run blogo:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Blogo is now available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can now [create your first article](#create-your-first-article).

#### Create your first article

> For more complete instructions, read the [usage](#usage) guide.

- Run `docker exec -it blogo blogo -new my-post-slug` to create a new post.
- The new post is available in the `articles` folder as `my-post-slug.md`.

Put all your markdown files in the `articles` folder. You can also put your static files in the `static` folder (you will need to bind it).

## Usage

Using Blogo is pretty simple. Once you have blogo running, you can create new articles by just running `blogo -new my-post-slug`, where `my-post-slug` is the slug of the post (used in the url). This will create a new template in the `articles` folder. Edit that file with your favorite text editor. Once done, save it and Blogo will take care of the rest (yes, it auto-reloads).

> If you're on docker, you can run `docker exec -it blogo blogo -new my-post-slug` to create a new post.

### Metadata fields

Blogo uses YAML metadata to get the post info. The metadata is located at the top of the file, between `---` and `---`.

Here's a list of the available metadata fields:

- `Title`: The title of the post. This will also be used as the title for sharing and SEO.
- `Author`: The author of the post.
- `Summary`: The summary of the post. This is used in the index page. This will also be used as the description for sharing and SEO.
- `Image`: The image of the post. This is used as the post thumbnail / header image. This will also be used as the thumbnail when sharing.
- `Tags`: The tags of the post. Must be a list of strings. This will also be used as the keywords for SEO.
- `Date`: The date of the post. Must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`.
- `Draft`: Whether the post is a draft or not. Must be `true` or `false`.
- `Layout`: The layout of the post. For now, only `post` is available.
- `NostrUrl`: The url to the Nostr content. If set to `0` it will disable the posting of that article to Nostr even if Nostr publishing is enabled.

### About page

To create an about page, just create a file called `about.md` in the `articles` folder. Blogo will automatically detect it and create a link to it in the navbar.

### Static Content

To add your own static content, you can just bind-mount any folder to `/app/static/your-folder`. Just add a volume `-v $(pwd)/img:/app/static/img`.

If you are using docker compose, you can add:

```
volumes:
    - ./img:/app/static/img
```

Then you can just use `/static/img/your-image.jpg` in the markdown to add an image.

> The `/app/static` folder contains the css styles needed for styling Blogo. For this, it is recommended to always create subfolders with bind mounts inside.

### Publish to Nostr

If you set the `PUBLISH_TO_NOSTR` variable in the `.env` file to `true`, Blogo will publish your posts to Nostr. By default, Blogo will generate an ephemeral key (changes on every restart) and use a default relay list. 

You can change either of these defaults by setting any of these variables in the `.env` file:

- `NOSTR_NSEC` - expects a valid `nsec` key. If you set this key, your posts will be always published for the same key, even on restarts.
    - You can generate a new Nostr key pair using `blogo -nkeys`.
- `NOSTR_RELAY_LIST` - expects a comma-separated list of relays (with protocol); eg. `wss://relay1.com,wss://relay2.net`.

> You can avoid publishing a particular post to Nostr by setting the `NostrUrl` metadata field in the post to `false` or `0`.

> Posts are published to Nostr as [Long-Form events](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/23.md) following the definition in [NIP-33](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/33.md#referencing-and-tagging).

### Add analytics

You can add analytics to your blog by setting the `BLOGO_ANALYTICS` variable in the `.env` file to your analytics script. Blogo will automatically add it to the bottom of the page. **Make sure to put it all in a single line**!

```env
BLOGO_ANALYTICS='<script defer src="https://my.analytics.site/script.js"></script>'
```

## Customization

You can customize the look and feel of your blog by editing the templates and CSS. 

### Templates

The templates are located in the `templates` folder:

- `base.html`: The base template. All other templates extend this one.
    - Receives: A [Config](https://github.com/pluja/blogo/-/blob/main/blogo/models.go) struct with the name `Blogo`.
- `index.html`: The index template. This is the template used for the index page, where the posts are listed.
    - Receives: a list of articles [[]Article](https://github.com/pluja/blogo/-/blob/main/blogo/models.go) and the welcome text (string).
- `post.html`: The post template. This is the template used for the post reading page.
    - Receives: an [Article](https://github.com/pluja/blogo/-/blob/main/blogo/models.go).
- `about.html`: The about template. This is the template used for the about page.

### Styles

The templates are written in Golang Templates, and the CSS is written in TailwindCSS and pure CSS. Feel free to tweak them to your liking.

The CSS is located in the `static/css` folder. 

The main content makes use of TailwindCSS classes, so you can just tweak that to your liking. Note: You will need to rebuild the TailwindCSS using `npx` for new classes to apply.

> The rendered Markdown is styled with pure CSS. You can tweak that in the `static/css/markdown.css` file. All markdwon is wrapped inside a `div` with the `markdown` id, so you can use that to style it.

#### Adding more stylesheets

You can easily add custom stylesheets to any page. Place the stylesheet into the `static/css/ ` folder. Then, just use the `extra` block from the template to link them. (take a look at the `post.html` template and look for the `extra` block to see how it's done).
